# MajorHelp

MajorHelp is a web application that helps students find universities, majors, and related information to assist them in making informed decisions. It includes features like user reviews, tuition calculators, and saved colleges for a personalized experience. For detailed descriptions and design decisions, refer to our [wiki pages](#link-to-wiki).

## External Requirements

List all the stuff the reader will need to install in order to get you app to
run in their laptop. For example:

In order to build this project you first have to install:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**.

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
