# MajorHelp

MajorHelp is a web application that helps students find universities, majors, and related information to assist them in making informed decisions. It includes features like user reviews, tuition calculators, and saved colleges for a personalized experience. For detailed descriptions and design decisions, refer to our [wiki pages](https://github.com/SCCapstone/pestopanini/wiki).

# Installation

> [!NOTE]
> It is highly recommended to run MajorHelp with a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), or **venv** so that dependencies for this project are kept local and not system wide. 
> This guide was written with virtual environments in mind, so some commands may have to be run while venv is activated.

## Windows
<details>
<summary>Windows Installation Guide</summary>

### Setting up venv and installing dependencies
To set up the virtual environment and install dependencies, run this code in powershell

```powershell copy
python -m venv venv\
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<details>
<summary> (Using cmd?) </summary>

```cmd copy
py -m venv venv\
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> (Execution policy error?) </summary>

If you're having issues executing ``venv\Scripts\activate.bat``, then you might have to update your execution policy

THIS CHANGE IS PERMAMENT AND AFFECTS SYSTEM GLOBALLY 

```powershell copy
set-executionpolicy remotesigned
```
Run this command as administrator 


Reset the execution policy with this

```powershell copy
set-executionpolicy restricted
```

</details>

<br>

This will create the virtual environment and place your shell inside it. 

### Running a local instance of MajorHelp

While **inside of the virtual environment**, run 

```powershell copy
python manage.py runserver
```

Exit the server by pressing Ctrl + C while in the shell.

<details>
<summary> (Using cmd?) </summary>

```cmd copy
py manage.py runserver
```

</details>



<br>

To host MajorHelp on a non local enviornment, see [Deployment](#deployment)

### Activating Venv

```powershell copy
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

<details>
<summary> (Using cmd?) </summary>

```cmd copy
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

</details>

### Exiting Venv

Simply run

```powershell copy
deactivate
```
</details>

## Linux

<summary>Linux Installation Guide</summary>

### Setting up venv and installing dependencies
To set up the virtual environment and install dependencies, run this code in your shell


```bash copy
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br>

This will create the virtual environment and place your shell inside it.

# Deployment
For deployment, choose a hosting provider like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Set up environment variables such as DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and other production-related variables. Migrate the database with python manage.py migrate --noinput, and collect static files using python manage.py collectstatic --noinput. Follow your hosting providerâ€™s deployment steps, ensuring that sensitive credentials like passwords are not pushed to your Git repository.

# Testing

> [!NOTE]
> The behavoral tests in ``MajorHelp/behaviortests/`` will fail if the server is not already running locally.

## Windows
<details>
<summary> Windows Guide </summary>

### Prerequisites

First, start by activating the virtual environment if you haven't already

```powershell copy
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

<details>
<summary> (Using cmd?) </summary>

```cmd copy
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

</details>
<br>

Next, make sure you have a local instance of the server running, preferably in another terminal
(Make sure you're activated)

```powershell copy
python manage.py runserver
```
<details>
<summary> (Using cmd?) </summary>

```cmd copy
py manage.py runserver
```

</details>
<br>




#### Running the tests

While the server is running, simply run 

```powershell copy
python -m pytest
```

and both the unit and behavioral tests will run.

</details>


## Linux

### Method 1 - Oneliner (Bash)

This oneliner will activate the venv, start the server in the background, run the tests, and then closes the server,
```bash copy
source venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver &> /dev/null & pytest ; kill %- 
```

### Method 2 - Manual
