I was busy when most of my team did their individual projects so in order to be complete with my individual work I am going to set up a merge conflict on my own.

I have created two branches, each with a file called 'a'.

in branch one, it just contains "Hello World!", in branch two, it contains what you see now.


Technically, all you need to do is resolve a merge conflict, doesn't matter if you start one yourself (most of the time I only get merge conflicts by myself anyway!)


I will then merge these branches.


After a bit, I will archive all related branches.
