    This targets the spans contained in the list elements of every
    unordered list of the class outputList. A bit of a mouthful but
    this prevents each li/span from needing to be assigned a class.

    This won't be as an issue if the li's are made via a template for
    loop.

    If need be, if you need to change this to be a class, I suggest the
    name "itemizedNumber" and apply it to the span, as it controls the 
    "$X,XXX" and places it to the right.
